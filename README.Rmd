## Installation

```{r}
#install_github("zhamel/foo")
library(foo)
```

## Usage

This package consists of 4 functions which hopefully can make your life easier when dealing with factors.

### `fbind()`

**Goal**: Bind two factors together to get back a factor with the levels from both factors.

```{r}
fbind(iris$Species[c(1, 51, 101)], PlantGrowth$group[c(1, 11, 21)])
```

### `freq_out()`

**Goal**: Create a data frame consisting of the levels of the factor and its frequency.

```{r}
freq_out(iris$Species)
```

### `reorder_levels()`

**Goal**: Reordering the levels based on frequency (from least to most)

```{r}
reorder_levels(factor(c("a","a","b","c","c","c","c","d","d","d")))
```

### `factor_to_char()`

**Goal**: Should your factor be a character instead? This function compares the length of the factor with the number of levels. If the length of the factor = # of levels of the factor, then `factor_to_char()` returns `TRUE`: maybe this shouldn't be a factor! Otherwise, if they are different, `factor_to_char()` returns `FALSE`: this time you may want to keep it as a factor!

```{r}
factor_to_char(iris$Species)
```
